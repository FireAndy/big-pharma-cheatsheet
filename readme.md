## An interactive cheat sheet for the game Big Pharma

Optimistically hacked with angular without tests. 

It's mainly a spoiler for all the cures in the game, and secondly a cheat sheet to
avoid swapping to the ingredients and cure tabs all the time.  

The interactive bonus is that you can enter sales prices for the cures and sort by them.
You can also sort by concentration, making it easier to spot complementary cures.

Feel free to fork and contribute, or make your own.
